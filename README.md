# Context-Aware Multi-Criteria Recommendation System (CA-MCR)
Overview: This project presents a cutting-edge Context-Aware Multi-Criteria Recommendation System (CA-MCR) using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for enhanced prediction accuracy. By integrating user contextual information with multi-criteria ratings, this system personalizes recommendations more effectively than traditional models.

Key Features:
Advanced Feature Extraction: Utilizes DNN embedding layers to automatically extract hidden features, improving the recommendation process without manual intervention.
High Accuracy: Achieved lower RMSE and MAE scores of 1.0488 and 0.79, respectively, outperforming existing models in the field.
Dataset: Utilizes the TripAdvisor dataset with multi-criteria ratings across various hotels.
Technologies Used:

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Machine Learning, TripAdvisor Dataset
Impact: By leveraging deep learning, this project demonstrates significant improvements in personalized recommendations, making it a valuable contribution to the field of recommendation systems.
